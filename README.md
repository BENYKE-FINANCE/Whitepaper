BENYKE FINANCE WHITEPAPER

OVERVIEW

“Ultimately the goal of crypto is not to play games with million-dollar pictures of monkeys, it’s to do things that accomplish meaningful effects in the real world,” Vitalik Buterin

Benyke Finance was inspired by the above submission of one among the leading voices in crypto space. This comes with the desire to take Decentralized Finance and NFTs to a whole new level by solving those financial problems, whose solutions are only currently assessed in the centralized world.
The world has woken to a reality of absolute WEB3 future of internet technology. 

The shift from web2 to web3 is gradually getting momentum with its promise to wrestle the control from big tech firms who currently owe their essence to the centralized platforms and create a new world with users having control over their data, while opening the doors to abundance, freedom and prosperity.
We duly realise this change we seek will not be instant, as both web2 and web3 will exist alongside each other for a long time to come and may sometimes be combined in the process as we transition to  a true decentralized world. 

Currently, nearly all big corporations and governments are run on web2, the technology that gives them huge control over the affairs of men. Meanwhile, these institutions as it is today are known to be rendering one service to the other which are absolutely necessary to the survival of this world. And we know that, not all these services can be replicated on web3 without serious challenges. This essentially is the core reason why the movement is considered wise to be gradual while Web3 evolves and replaces the old ways of doing things.
The world of finance is currently dominated by the centralized inclined operators with huge support from the governments and institutions, both local and international. 

Although, the introduction of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are today celebrated by a class of the society, who craves a decentralized finance world, the resistance from the governments and their regulatory institutions is a significant factor in the advancement of the recent waves of decentralized finance. The central authorities are clearly unwilling to let go of the grip they hold over the world finances. However, this will not be long as more and more discoveries and projects are coming into the space to address apparent challenges.

This is the bedrock for the establishment of Benyke Finance, a cryptocurrency project with the desire to replicate traditional financial solutions in the expanding decentralized finance world, while combining the useful purposes which NFTs are deemed to serve in crypto space”
